    <h2>1. What is JavaScript? And also Explain the histroy of JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>ans: JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language widely used in web development. It plays a crucial role in both front-end and back-end development, enabling dynamic and interactive user experiences. Unlike compiled languages, JavaScript is interpreted through web browsers, making it highly accessible and versatile. It is a loosely typed (or weakly typed) language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.</p>
    history:
    <p>Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. As the web gained popularity, a gradual demand for client-side scripting languages developed. Most Internet users were connected to a 28.8 kbps modem at the time, even when web pages were growing in size and complexity. Netscape began to think seriously about developing client-side scripting language early, at a cutting-edge time of technological innovation, to handle simple processing. Brendan Eich is the person who worked for Netscape at that time and began developing a scripting language named "Mocha", later named "LiveScript", for the release of Netscape Navigator 2 in 1995. He was fascinated by Java, Scheme, and Self. Netscape, for some time, made the best browser of that time and enjoyed market supremacy.</p>
    <h2>2. Why We use JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>ans: Uses of JavaScript</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>to create web application</li>
        <li>Client-side validation.</li>
        <li> Displaying date and time.</li>
        <li>To validate the user input before submission of the form.</li>
        <li>  Open and close new windows.</li>
        <li>To display dialog boxes and pop-up windows.</li>
        <li>To change the appearance of HTML documents.</li>
        <li>To create the forms that respond to user input without accessing the server.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>3. Explain ECMA in JS.</h2>
    <p>Ans: ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and      ActionScript. It is best known as a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. It is standardized by Ecma International in the document ECMA-262.

        ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for server-side applications and services using runtime environments - Node.js, deno and bun.</p>
        <h2>4. JavaScript Assignment1, What are the different data types present in javascript?
            What are the JavaScript Engines?</h2>
            <p>Ans: JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

                Primitive data type
                Non-primitive (reference) data type
                JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>Primitive Datatype
                        <li>Number</li>
                        <li>String</li>
                        <li>Boolean</li>
                        <li>Undefined</li>
                        <li>Null</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>Non-primitive
                        <li>Array</li>
                        <li>Object</li>
                    </ol>
